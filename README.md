Problem Statement: Vehicle Results and Filtering

You are tasked with implementing a simple vehicle results page in React Native. You should use Visual Studio Code to develop your solution and commit your code to a publicly accessible repo like GitHub.

## Requirements

Import the dataset of vehicles from the provided Json file. This file contains a randomly generated set of vehicles. Each vehicle should have the following properties:
‚Ä¢ Make
‚Ä¢ Model
‚Ä¢ Engine Size
‚Ä¢ Fuel Type
‚Ä¢ Year
‚Ä¢ Mileage
‚Ä¢ Auction Date and Time
‚Ä¢ Starting Bid
‚Ä¢ Favourite

Your application should store this data in state (of your choosing) and present the results in a friendly format. For each vehicle, please include a placeholder for an image. Feel free to indicate this is a placeholder, or choose your own image to display. Each vehicle should display the number of days and hours until its auction begins. Each vehicle in the results should clearly indicate if a user has selected the vehicle as a ‚Äúfavourite‚Äù.

A user can interact with the page in the following ways‚Ä¶

Provide the ability to filter by Make, Model, a Starting Bid range, and/or show only a user‚Äôs ‚Äúfavourite‚Äù vehicles.

Allow a user to favourite or un-favourite a vehicle.

Allow a user to click a vehicle in the results to display a vehicle details page about the clicked vehicle. Feel free to pad this page out with lorem ipsum to represent more detail.
